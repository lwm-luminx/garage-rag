# Jev Resources

Jev launched on 15 September 2026. This field is one week old: links below were checked on 21 September 2026 and this page will age fast. Concepts in [system one models](system-one-models.md).

## Official

- [Introducing System One Models & Jev](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev) — the launch post; claims, pricing, naming
- [TypeSafe docs](https://docs.typesafe.ai/) and [System One concepts](https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/system-one) — API shape, primitives, limits
- [HTTP API reference](https://docs.typesafe.ai/api) and [workflow evals](https://evals.typesafe.ai/) — the vendor's own benchmark methodology
- [Console](https://console.typesafe.ai/) — waitlist, keys, playground
- SDKs: [JavaScript](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-js), [Python](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-python)

## Third-party explainers and writeups

- [Wikipedia: Jev (AI model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jev_(AI_model)) — neutral summary; company, funding, versions
- [LangChain: building a harness with Jev](https://www.langchain.com/blog/building-a-harness-with-jev) — the agent-stack integration; see [Jev in an agent stack](jev-in-an-agent-stack.md)
- [DataCamp: System One models and Jev](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/system-one-models-jev) — good comparative benchmark table
- [Valyu: how to use Jev](https://dev.to/valyuai/how-to-use-jev-a-practical-guide-to-typesafes-system-one-model-g5e) — the best practical guide so far; patterns and gotchas
- [MindStudio launch coverage](https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/jev-system-one-model-launch) — simulator demos with real cost numbers
- [AI News: ChatGPT pioneer launches Jev](https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/chatgpt-pioneer-launches-jev-model-for-programmatic-logic/) — founder background
- [awesome-typesafe-jev](https://github.com/AbdelStark/awesome-typesafe-jev) — community-maintained link list, demos, integrations
- Gateway integrations: [Pydantic AI](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/models/typesafe/), [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/pass_through/typesafe), [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai/models/typesafe/jev/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/changelog/typesafe-jev-ai-gateway/)

## Sceptical takes

- [Anthony Maio: the language model that won't talk](https://anthonymaio.substack.com/p/jev-the-language-model-that-wont) — best critical read; calibration and distribution shift remain unproven
- [KDnuggets: what everyone is getting wrong about Jev](https://www.kdnuggets.com/what-everyone-is-getting-wrong-about-typesafe-ais-jev) — "zero hallucinations" means zero out-of-schema outputs, not zero wrong answers
- [MindStudio: RLCD vs RLHF](https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/typesafe-jev-rlcd-vs-rlhf) — what the training claim actually asserts

Bear in mind that every performance number in circulation traces back to TypeSafe's own evals. Independent, large-scale evaluations did not exist at the time of writing; when they appear, they belong at the top of this page.

## Start here

1. Read the launch post, then Maio's sceptical piece straight after — vendor claim and counterweight in one sitting.
2. Work through [what Jev is good for](what-jev-is-good-for.md) and decide whether any of your workloads are Jev-shaped.
3. Join the waitlist, then run the triage eval from [getting started](getting-started.md) against your own labelled data before believing any benchmark.
